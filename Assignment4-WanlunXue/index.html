                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Succ Shop is a family owned and operated succulent nursery.
                        Since opening our doors in 1990, we have grown hundreds of
                        varieties for our mail order catalogue, including Sempervivum,
                        Sedum, Jovibarba heuffelli, Rosularia, Haworthia, Kalanchoe, Senecio,
                        Aeonium, Tender Sedum, hybrids, and more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since then, our collection has expanded to include over 650 different
                        varieties of hardy and soft succulents. New varieties continue to be
                        added to our online catalogue each month throughout the year.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Watering</h2>
                    <p>
                        A common misconception is that succulents donít need very much water to survive. They in fact
                        need enough water to keep their leaves, stem and root full in order to withstand periods of
                        drought.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best way to water succulents and encourage healthy root growth is to completely soak the
                        soil and allow it to dry out completely before watering again. Lightly spraying the soil will
                        cause succulents to put off small thin roots which will easily wither and die. Soaking the soil
                        allows them to absorb the water they need. Letting the soil dry out completely allows the
                        succulent time to grow and put off strong healthy roots.

                    <h2>Container Gardening</h2>
                    <p>
                        Succulents are tough plants and can grow in a variety of places. For long term growing, itís
                        generally best to place them in a container with a drainage hole and to use well-draining soil.
                        While you can plant succulents in fun containers with no drainage such as old shoes, tea cups,
                        votives, etc. they may not be the best long term solutions due to watering challenges.
                        Terracotta or ceramic pots will dry out more quickly than plastic or other materials, so be sure
                        to adjust watering accordingly. As succulents get too big for the container they are in, you can
                        cut back the new growth and plant it elsewhere or move the whole plant to a larger container.
